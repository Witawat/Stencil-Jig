# Stencil-Jig

The Stencil-Jig is a simple DIY machine for PCB stenciling built with the Openbuilds v-slot system. Dealing with those stencils is always tricky, because they have to be aligned perfectly to get great soldering results. So far, I was always using these stencils with spare PCBs around the project PCB which are fixed in position with tape. As I am using these stencils quite often in the last time I was thinking about creating a simple jig for it and here it is.

The stencils can be clamped into the Stencil-Jig with the inner v-slot extrusions and with all the adjustment screws on the sides and the front the PCB underneath the stencil and the stencil itself can be aligned easily (at least this is the plan).

## Extrusions

V-slot extrusions are probably not necessary here, because the v-bearings are not used. Nevertheless I have chosen them because of the availability and v-style of the slots in order to align 3D-printed parts with only one screw.

For this project you will need 5x 500mm 2020 extrusions which will be cut into these dimensions:

- 6x 250mm; width of the jig (it is probably 249,5mm, because I have just cut a 500mm extrusion in half)
- 2x 500mm; length of the jig (can be shortened later, so I leaved it as it is first)
