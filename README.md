The Stencil-Jig is a simple DIY machine for PCB stenciling built with the Openbuilds v-slot system. Dealing with those stencils is always tricky, because they have to be aligned perfectly to get great soldering results. So far, I was always using these stencils with spare PCBs around the project PCB which are fixed in position with tape. As I am using these stencils quite often in the last time I was thinking about creating a simple jig for it and here it is.

The stencils can be clamped into the Stencil-Jig with the inner v-slot extrusions and with all the adjustment screws on the sides and the front the PCB underneath the stencil and the stencil itself can be aligned easily (at least this is the plan).

## Extrusions

V-slot extrusions are probably not necessary here, because the v-bearings are not used. Nevertheless I have chosen them because of the availability and v-style of the slots in order to align 3D-printed parts with only one screw.

For this project you will need 5x 500mm 2020 extrusions which will be cut into these dimensions:

- 6x 250mm; width of the jig (it is probably 249,5mm, because I have just cut a 500mm extrusion in half)
- 2x 500mm; length of the jig (can be shortened later, so I leaved it as it is first)

## What to print

For the complete machine, as it is seen in the picture below, you'll need the following parts to be printed:

- 1x hinge_left.stl
- 1x hinge_right.stl
- 2x slide_mount_hinge.stl
- 2x slide_mount_front.stl
- 4x slider.stl
- 2x slider_stop.stl
- 2x alignment_guide.stl
- 1x screwstop_m4_nut.stl
- 1x screwstop_m4.stl
- 1x knob_m4_nut.stl
- 4x screwstop_m3_side.stl
- 4x knob_m3.stl
- 1x pcb_mount_edge.stl
- 1x pcb_mount_straight.stl

## What to buy

Except the 3D printed parts and the extrusions listed above you will also need the following parts:

- 2x 8mm stainless steel rod (length = length of the jig - 40mm)
- 4x 625RS bearings (16x5x5mm)
- 2x spring for the 8mm rod
- 4x M3 threaded rod ~100mm
- 1x M4 threaded rod ~100mm
- 1x steel plate 1mm (~290mmx250mm)
- 2x aluminium extrusion 5x20x220mm
- 4x extrusion corner 4040
- 4x M3 threaded insert
- 1x M4 threaded insert
- Xx M4 screw DIN_X 8mm
- Xx M4 screw DIN_X 12mm
- 4x M4 screw DIN_X 25mm
- 2x M5 screw DIN_X 50mm
- 2x M5 screw DIN_X 20mm
- Xx M4 extrusion nuts
- 1x M4 self-locking nut
